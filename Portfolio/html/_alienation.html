    This project was done within my Image class for my major, which I took in an
    intnesive short-form summer course format. The goals of this project was to
    simply make a video under a minute using any form of animations and
    keyframes. However, I must of not seen the under one minute requirement, and
    went way over the top. In only a few days I managed to make this full movie,
    making every aspect, even the song near the end. I had a blast making this
    and I hope you enjoy as well!
