        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          The "Hide & Treat" is a product my team and I designed which was
          shaped through the rigorous steps of the stage-gate process.
          Formulating several ideas throug hthe process, we narrowed our product
          down through the industry trends, surveys and overall ROI of our new
          product launch. We settled on the Hide & Treat, which is dog toy
          designed for consumers who want to entertian their furry companions,
          without the need of physical assertion or a backyard. The toy is meant
          to be sprayed by our signiture scents, then rubbed along a trail to be
          hidden for the dog to find, providing amazing entertainment for both
          you and your dog, without the need for the time and effort involved in
          playing fetch with your dog. In this page I will highlight the main
          acheivemnts we hit along this journey.

        <h2>Identifying Consumer Segment and their unfulfilled needs.</h2>
        <p>
          The first step of our producut devlopemnt process involved choosing a
          general idea of what kind of product we wanted to create. Our team was
          back and forth on a bunch of ideas, from drinks to mobile apps, but
          ultimatly we felt that . With the dog toy industry in mind, we had to
          uncover some of consumers pain points when using toys with their dogs.
          To acheive this, we conducted simple interviews with dog owners,
          asking open ended questions such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How often do you typically play with your dog?</li>
          <li>What factors prevent you from playing with your dog?</li>
          <li>What do you dislike most about dog toys in general?</li>
          <li>
            How often are you out of the house away from your dog, and how
            important is it for you to find varoius ways to keep your dog
            entertained?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          With this information we relaized there was a lot of pain points when
          it comes to consumers and entertaining their furry companion. We found
          out that most people are willing to do anyhting to make their dog
          happy, but it is often difficult to find the time an energy to go out
          and play with your dog everyday. This allowed us to focus our ideas on
          something to help consumers who feel the same.

        <h2>Creating Products to Help our Target Market</h2>
        <p>
          After identifying consumers needs, we had a better understanding the
          gaps our product should fill in the consumers product use. With this,
          my team and I were able to genererate hundreds of ideas through
          several brainstorming sessions. However, as a team we had to ultimatly
          decide on our two favorite ideas. These ideas were of course the Hide
          & Treat, as well as the "Canine Crafter", which was an AI tool that
          would help consumers create a dog toy prefect for their dog, being
          both generated and 3D printed by us. Though I strongly disliked this
          idea, I knew I could not let my personel prefernces get in the way, as
          these two products would go head to head through a large qaulatative
          survey. To effectively test our products, we had to create produduct
          statements for each of our products which followed certain guidelines
          to reflect the standard of product statments in our industry.
          <br />
          <br />

          Before our large survey, we had to first conduct qaulatative research
          through surveys on each of our products, mainly to understand where we
          could make improvements in the specific product allowing us to improve
          the product statement, which would be used in our quatative survey. To
          conduct these interviews we went to dog centric locations such as dog
          parks and pet stores, asking the consumer give us feedback on our
          current product ideas. Along with the participants genreal thoughts on
          the idea, we also asked some specific qustions regarding features of
          the product itself such as what scents they would prefer, and what
          material/color they would expect the final product to be.
