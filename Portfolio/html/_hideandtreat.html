      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>
        The "Hide & Treat" is a product my team and I designed which was shaped
        through the rigorous steps of the stage-gate process. Formulating
        several ideas throug hthe process, we narrowed our product down through
        the industry trends, surveys and overall ROI of our new product launch.
        We settled on the Hide & Treat, which is dog toy designed for consumers
        who want to entertian their furry companions, without the need of
        physical assertion or a backyard. The toy is meant to be sprayed by our
        signiture scents, then rubbed along a trail to be hidden for the dog to
        find, providing amazing entertainment for both you and your dog, without
        the need for the time and effort involved in playing fetch with your
        dog. In this page I will highlight the main acheivemnts we hit along
        this journey.

        <h2>Identifying Consumer Segment and their unfullfilled needs.</h2>
        <p>
          The first step of our producut devlopemnt process involved choosing a
          general idea of what kind of product we wanted to create. Our team was
          back and forth on a bunch of ideas, from drinks to mobile apps, but
          ultimatly we felt that . With the dog toy industry in mind, we had to
          uncover some of consumers pain points when using toys with their dogs.
          To acheive this, we conducted simple interviews with dog owners,
          asking open ended questions such as:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>How often do you typically play with your dog?</li>
          <li>What factors prevent you from playing with your dog?</li>
          <li>What do you dislike most about dog toys in general?</li>
          <li>
            How often are you out of the house away from your dog, and how
            important is it for you to find varoius ways to keep your dog
            entertained?
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          With this information we relaized there was a lot of pain points when
          it comes to consumers and entertaining their furry companion. We found
          out that most people are willing to do anyhting to make their dog
          happy, but it is often difficult to find the time an energy to go out
          and play with your dog everyday. This allowed us to focus our ideas on
          something to help consumers who feel the same.

        <h2>Creating Products to Help our Target Market</h2>
        <p>
          After identifying consumers needs, we had a better understanding the
          gaps our product should fill in the consumers product use. With this,
          my team and I were able to genererate hundreds of ideas through
          several brainstorming sessions. However, as a team we had to ultimatly
          decide on our two favorite ideas. These ideas were of course the Hide
          & Treat, as well as the "Canine Crafter", which was an AI tool that
          would help consumers create a dog toy prefect for their dog, being
          both generated and 3D printed by us. Though I strongly disliked this
          idea, I knew I could not let my personel prefernces get in the way, as
          these two products would go head to head through a large qaulatative
          survey. To effectively test our products, we had to create produduct
          statements for each of our products which followed certain guidelines
          to reflect the standard of product statments in our industry.
          <br>
          <br>

          Before our large survey, we had to first conduct qaulatative research
          through surveys on each of our products, mainly to understand where we
          could make improvements in the specific product allowing us to improve
          the product statement, which would be used in our quatative survey. To
          conduct these interviews we went to dog centric locations such as dog
          parks and pet stores, asking the consumer give us feedback on our
          current product ideas. Along with the participants genreal thoughts on
          the idea, we also asked some specific qustions regarding features of
          the product itself such as what scents they would prefer, and what
          material/color they would expect the final product to be.

      <div class="productDiv">
        <h2>Conducting Surveys to Decide on our Product</h2>
        <p>
          With our product statements for both "Hide & Treat" and "Canine
          Crafter" finalized we moved on to creating/condcucting our surveys
          using
          <a href="https://www.qualtrics.com/">Qualtrics</a>. To avoid any
          potnetial bias, a participant would be able to provide answers on only
          one of our two products. This would allow the participant to give
          feedback on the product, without unknowingly comparing it to the other
          product idea they saw. Each survey also followed the same layout which
          consisted of the following:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            The product concept, and how the product is meant to be used
            allowing the participants to anser the questions
          </li>
          <li>
            Open ended question on what the participant specifiaclly likes about
            the product
          </li>
          <li>
            Open ended question on what the participant specifiaclly dislikes
            about the product
          </li>
          <li>The likelihood they would purchase the product in general</li>
          <li>
            The likelihood they would purchase the product at a specific price
            point, if they do not answer at either "definitly would purchase" or
            "probably would purchase", the participant would be given the same
            question with a lower specified price point.
          </li>
          <li>
            What would be their maximum price point, and what price would be so
            low that they would question the quality of the product
          </li>
          <li>Open ended feedback on what they believe is the main benift</li>

          <li>
            How unique the product is, and whether or not they think it would
            actually work
          </li>
          <li>General questions on the participants demograghic</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          With this information our team had all the knowledge we needed to move
          forward into the project. The data did not only consist of the
          participants general fedback on each idea and what people liked better
          on average, but also the necessry data to create the price for each
          product using a formula we were given in class. This would allow us to
          determine the financail feasablitly of launching each product. If you
          would like to take the survey to get a better idea of it, you may do

          With both the survey results and extensive converstation, our team
          decided to go with the "Hide & Treat" for our final product. At this
          point we had to develop all the necessary data and content to show
          just how succesful our product launch would be. First was our
          determining the contriibution margin for our prodcut, which involved
          generating a price using our survey data, then looking at several
          websites to determine how much materials and manufacturing would cost
          us per unit. With that had to determine the sales we could expect on
          prodcut launch, in which we had several ways of calculating, but
          ultimatly we felt that a bottom up forcasting approach was best, as it
          would most accuratly represent the number of sales.
