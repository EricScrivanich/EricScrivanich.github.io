      <p class = "explanation"> For this assigmnet I used an API that has fake credit card information. The specific data I needed was within an array, which are eached passed as parameters to
        my display function. This API did not have a lot of data, so I added the functionaialy that displays the first array, then the second array
        before grabbing a new set from the API. I also realized that some of the sets of data did not have a full 16 numbers for the cards
        digits, so when that occurs, I randomly generate the required amount of numbers and add them. Then I also add spaces between the numbers
        every 4 digits. Lastly, and most importantly, I added a "Cha-Ching" sound effect when the button is pressed, along with kanye qoutes from a different API. Enjoy!
