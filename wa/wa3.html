        Kanye West has long been the center of controversy, Most notably when he took the microphone from <a href="https://maddycorzine.github.io/wa/wa3.html">Taylor Swift</a>, after she won a grammy. But before the fame, he came from 
    humble beginnings. Born June 8, 1977, Kanye is an American rapper, singer, songwriter, 
    record producer, and fashion designer. Born in Atlanta and raised in Chicago, West gained 
    recognition as a producer for Roc-A-Fella Records in the early 2000s, producing singles for 
    several prominent artists and developing a production style that heavily sampled old-school 
    soul music. Intent on pursuing a solo career as a rapper, he released his debut studio album, 
    The College Dropout (2004), to critical and commercial success. He founded the record label GOOD 
    Music later that year. West explored diverse musical elements like orchestras, synthesizers, and 
    autotune on the albums Late Registration (2005), Graduation (2007), and 808s & Heartbreak (2008). 
    His fifth and sixth albums My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (2010) and Yeezus (2013) were also met 
    with critical and commercial success. West further diversified his musical styles on The Life of Pablo 
    (2016) and Ye (2018) and explored Christian and gospel music on Jesus Is King (2019). His tenth album Donda 
    (2021) was released to commercial success and mixed critical reception. Wests discography also includes the 
    two full-length collaborative albums Watch the Throne (2011) with Jay-Z and Kids See Ghosts (2018) with Kid Cudi.

    West was born on June 8, 1977, in Atlanta, Georgia. After his parents divorced when he was three years old, he 
moved with his mother to Chicago, Illinois. His father, Ray West, is a former Black Panther and was one of the 
first black photojournalists at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Ray later became a Christian counselor, and in 2006, 
opened the Good Water Store and Café in Lexington Park, Maryland, with startup capital from his son. West's mother, 
Donda C. West (née Williams), was a professor of English at Clark Atlanta University and the Chair of the English Department 
at Chicago State University before retiring to serve as his manager. West was raised in a middle-class environment, attending 
Polaris School for Individual Education in suburban Oak Lawn, Illinois, after living in Chicago. At the age of 10, West
moved with his mother to Nanjing, China, where she was teaching at Nanjing University as a Fulbright Scholar. According to 
his mother, West was the only foreigner in his class, but he settled in well and quickly picked up the language, although he has 
since forgotten most of it. When asked about his grades in high school, West replied, "I got A's and B's."
West demonstrated an affinity for the arts at an early age; he began writing poetry when he was five years old.
West started rapping in the third grade and began making musical compositions in the seventh grade, eventually selling 
them to other artists. West crossed paths with producer No I.D., who became West's friend and mentor. After graduating from high school, 
West received a scholarship to attend Chicago's American Academy of Art in 1997 and began taking painting classes. Shortly after, he transferred 
to Chicago State University to study English. At age 20, he dropped out to pursue his musical career. This greatly displeased his mother, 
who was also a professor at the university, although she would later accept the decision.

    West's musical career is defined by frequent stylistic shifts and different musical approaches. In the subsequent years since 
    his debut, West has both musically and lyrically taken an increasingly experimental approach to crafting progressive hip hop music 
    while maintaining accessible pop sensibilities. Ed Ledsham of PopMatters said that "West's melding of multiple genres 
    into the hip-hop fold is a complex act that challenges the dominant white notions of what constitutes true 'art' music." West's 
    rhymes have been described as funny, provocative and articulate, capable of seamlessly segueing from shrewd commentary to comical braggadocio 
    to introspective sensitivity. West imparts that he strives to speak in an inclusive manner so groups from different racial and gender backgrounds 
    can comprehend his lyrics, saying he desired to sound "just as ill as Jadakiss and just as understandable as Will Smith".[197] Early in his career, West 
    pioneered a style of hip-hop production dubbed "chipmunk-soul", a sampling technique involving the manipulation of tempo in order to chop and stretch 
    pitched-up samples from vintage soul songs. On his debut studio album, The College Dropout (2004), West formed the constitutive elements of 
    his style, described as intricate hip-hop beats, topical subject matter, and clumsy rapping laced with inventive wordplay.[192][202] The record saw West 
    diverge from the then-dominant gangster persona in hip hop in favor of more diverse, topical lyrical subjects, including higher education, materialism, 
    self-consciousness, minimum-wage labor, institutional prejudice, class struggle, family, sexuality, his struggles in the music industry, and middle-class upbringing.
     Over time, West has explored a variety of music genres, encompassing and taking inspiration from chamber pop on his second studio album, Late Registration (2005),
      arena rock and europop on his third album, Graduation (2007),[206][207] synth-driven electropop on his fourth album, 808s & Heartbreak (2008), acid-house, 
      drill, industrial rap and trap on Yeezus (2013),[105][210] gospel and Christian rap on The Life of Pablo (2016), Jesus is King (2019) and Donda (2021),
       and psychedelic music on Kids See Ghosts (2018)

      sports performance products like basketball, football, and soccer, although Adidas terminated the partnership with West in October 2022 due to his antisemitic remarks.
       In May 2021, West signed a 10-year deal linking Yeezy with GAP, however, in September 2022, West announced that he was ending the deal.

Jay-Z acquired the parent company of Tidal, Aspiro, in the first quarter of 2015.[253] Sixteen artist stakeholders including Jay-Z, Rihanna, Beyoncé, Madonna, Chris Martin, Nicki Minaj co-own Tidal, 
with the majority owning a 3% equity stake. In October 2022, in direct response to bans he received on Twitter and Instagram stemming from his antisemitic comments, West reached an agreement in 
principle to acquire the alt-tech social network Parler for an undisclosed amount.[256][257] Parler and West mutually agreed to terminate the proposed deal in mid-November.

      As spokesman for the campaign, West appeared in a series of PSAs for the organization, and hosted an inaugural benefit concert in August of that year.[262] In 2008, following the death of

    Inc., a program aimed at helping at-risk Chicago youth. West has contributed to hurricane relief in 2005 by participating in a Hurricane Katrina benefit concert after the storm had ravaged black
