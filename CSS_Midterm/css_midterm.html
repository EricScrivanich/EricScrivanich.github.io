        <h2>Vivaldi's The Four Seasons</h2>
        <h4>OCT14-16 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h4>
        <p>Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest conductor Aram Demirjian present a
            powerhouse program highlighted by Vivaldi’s programmatic masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking
            and admired as ever, this work conjures imagery that deftly captures the essence of spring, summer,
            autumn, and winter through music that manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its
            debut. Paul Huang is just the virtuoso to embrace this beloved concerto in its return to Boettcher Concert
            Hall.
            The grand finale — Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously structured meditation on fate
            that endures as one of his most popular and identifiable compositions. Over four movements,
            Tchaikovsky transforms his personal battle with fate into one of humanity’s most powerful works of art.
            Among today’s best and brightest composers, Jessie Montgomery’s Strum draws on the spirit of dance,
            movement, and American folk expressions in an ecstatic celebration that will have you on the edge of
            your seat.</p>

        <h2>Beethoven Symphony No. 8</h2>
        <h4>FEB 10-12 FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h4>
        <p>
            Beethoven’s Eighth — which he referred to as “my little Symphony in F,”— is the most cheery, joyful,
and experimental of his symphonies. Its relatively compact scale allowed Beethoven to be more
imaginative and structurally radical than he could dare to be on the larger canvases of his other
symphonies. Light-hearted and full of charm, the Eighth is an often-overlooked gem that will shine under
the baton of Resident Conductor Christopher Dragon. Celebrate the Colorado Symphony Horns as they
take center stage on Schumann’s Konzertstück for 4 Horns and Orchestra, incorporating the warmth,
nobility, and hunting-horn origins of German Romantic-era music while conjuring images of the
unspoiled forests of the German landscape. In an ironic twist, the performance begins with a “Farewell”,
harkening back to the piece’s debut when Haydn instructed his musicians to stop playing one by one
during the final movement, snuff out the candle on their music stand, and walk off the stage in turn,
leaving just two violins to convey the final notes. In this uniquely imaginative performance, seeing
is believing.

        <h2>Beethoven’s Emperor Concerto</h2>
        <h4>February 24-26 FRI-SAT 730 SUN 1:00</h4>
        <p>
            One of the most accomplished of all piano works, Beethoven’s “Emperor” Concerto features a striking
            opening movement and a glorious finale, with beauty and virtuosic style throughout that makes it one of
            the composer’s best. Your Colorado Symphony welcomes electrifying pianist Stewart Goodyear who is
            just the firebrand to live up to the wiles of this majestic and vigorously demanding concerto.
            Teddy Abrams — <em>Musical America’s</em> 2022 Conductor of the Year — brings dynamic flair to Perkinson’s
            energetic Worship Overture. Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony was so well received that within months of its
            American premiere, a portrait of the composer was featured on the cover of <em>Time magazine</em>. Prokofiev
            wrote that he “conceived of it as glorifying the grandeur of the human spirit, praising the free and happy
            man— his strength, his generosity, and the purity of his soul." This heroic and joyous work offers a
            brilliant conclusion to a performance of energizing masterworks.

        <h2>Bartók Concerto for Orchestra</h2>
        <h4>March 10th-12th FRI-SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h4>
        <p>
            One of the foremost conductors of his generation, Alexander Shelley joins your Colorado Symphony for a
            program that will leave you simply spellbound. Spanish composer Joaquín Rodrigo’s classical guitar
            concerto Concierto de Aranjuez fills the concert hall with the immortal sounds and traditions of Spanish
            romanticism in a must-hear interpretation from guitar virtuoso Pablo Sainz Villegas who was hailed as
            “The global ambassador of Spanish guitar” by Billboard Magazine. Anna Clyne’s This Midnight Hour is
            mysterious and foreboding, with musical twists and turns that show why she is considered one of the
            preeminent composers of our time. Bartók’s Concerto for Orchestra was called a concerto rather than a
            symphony as each section of instruments is treated in a soloistic and virtuosic way, combining elements
            of Western art music and Hungarian folk songs in a stirring finale to an evening of symphonic sublimity.

        <h2>Brahms Requiem with Peter Oundjian</h2>
        <h4>Mar 24–26 FRI–SAT 7:30 SUN 1:00</h4>
        <p>
            Unlike other Requiem Masses, Brahms ’A German Requiem is not primarily a Mass for the dead. Instead,
            it is intended as comfort and solace for those left behind as they mourn the death of others. Confronting
            life as much as it does death, Brahms further differentiates his Requiem by setting excerpts from the
            Lutheran Bible and apocrypha in German instead of the Catholic, Latin text used in the Requiem Masses
            by Mozart, Verdi, and Berlioz. The Colorado Symphony Chorus and two vocal soloists lend distinction to
            this stunning masterpiece, which remains one of the most revered choral works ever composed. A taste
            for the exotic surfaces often in the catalogue of Maurice Ravel and his orchestral song cycle Shéhérazade
            is no exception. Named for the protagonist of <em>One Thousand and One Nights</em>, Shéhérazade is a woman
            who employs her imagination as a means of escape. "Je voudrais voir...", she repeats, meaning "I would
            like to see...", this refrain sets the tone for Ravel’s song cycle which drips with color evoking images of
            the far east. Drawing on music from the opera, Weber’s Overture to Oberon is a celebration of the
            supernatural realm. Like in Mozart's The Magic Flute, Weber establishes Oberon's horn as a mystical
            instrument and its call as a leitmotif throughout the overture, unleashing an exuberant conversation
            between instrumental voices and concluding with a virtuosic flourish conducted by Maestro
            Peter Oundjian.
